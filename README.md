# Landing-Page

The Odin Project - Landing Page.

Setting up the project with GIT and using GitHub to preview the project. 

Code: HTML and CSS. 

Added a few media queries to make it responsive for mobile as well. 
Finished on july 20: might update the code later to make it cleaner. Also the margins and padding are a little bit different for each section.
